class SurgicalEditorLogic:
    """
    Implements the queued, two-loop (Gatekeeper/Worker) editing logic.
    This class is the core engine, designed to be UI-agnostic, communicating
    with a user interface (or other front-end) through a set of callbacks.
    It manages a queue of edit requests and processes them atomically,
    allowing for human review and intervention at key stages.

    The "two-loop" refers to:
    1. Gatekeeper Loop: User provides a hint and instruction. System locates the snippet. User confirms/corrects location.
    2. Worker Loop: System generates an edit for the confirmed snippet. User reviews diff, can edit, approve, or reject.

    Attributes:
        data (Dict[str, Any]): The current state of the data being edited.
        _initial_data_snapshot (Dict[str, Any]): A deep copy of the initial data, used for revert functionality.
        config (Dict[str, Any]): Configuration settings for the editor, potentially including field definitions.
        edit_results (list): A log of completed edit tasks and their outcomes.
        callbacks (Dict[str, Callable]): A dictionary of callback functions to interact with the UI.
            Expected callbacks:
                - 'update_view': To refresh the UI with the current data, config, and queue status.
                - 'show_error': To display error messages to the user.
                - 'confirm_location_details': To ask the user to confirm the located snippet.
                - 'show_diff_preview': To show the user a diff of the original and edited snippet.
                - 'request_clarification': To ask the user for more information if an edit is rejected.
        edit_request_queue (deque[Tuple[str, str, str]]): A queue for pending edit requests.
            Each tuple contains (user_hint, user_instruction, content_snapshot_at_request_time).
        active_edit_task (Optional[Dict[str, Any]]): Stores details of the currently processed edit task.
        main_text_field (str): The key in `self.data` that holds the primary text content to be edited.
        original_text_field (str): The key in `self.data` that might hold an original version for diffing (if configured).
